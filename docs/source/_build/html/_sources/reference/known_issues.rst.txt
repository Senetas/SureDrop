Known Issues
============

Cannot initialise company
-------------------------

I've installed SureDrop and when it is complete I'm trying to login to
SureDrop via the browser but I see the login page and I cannot
initialise company or create administrator password. I just see a login
page that looks like 

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/login.png
   :alt: Login page


Possible reasons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This generally happens because the browser cannot get a valid response
from the Rest endpoint, or there is a delay in getting the response.
Such failures could occur due to

-  Docker service not running - even if set to automatic sometimes the
   service fails to start after an OS restart. Please check and start
   the service from Windows ``services.msc``.

-  The CPU utilisation of the VM and / or the docker container(s) is
   very high (possibly 100%) - we advise you to wait until the VM is
   stable in terms of memory and CPU utilisation.

-  The docker container(s) couldn't start successfully

-  Other network related connectivity issues

Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to :doc:`these <../install/Diagnostics>` instructions.


Docker containers failing to start
----------------------------------

We've noticed that occasionally after a restart of Windows 2016 virtual
machines, windows docker containers fail to start up with error messages
like: ``HNS failed with error...``. Some issues like
`these <https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1384>`__ have been
formally reported and supposedly
`resolved <https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/34696>`__ via some
Windows updates; whereas
`others <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38070837/windows-container-failed-to-start-with-error-failed-to-create-endpoint-on-netw>`__
are still at large. Windows 2016 and Docker have had a history of
networking problems which have been resolved in Windows 2019. Thankfully
it is not a very frequent occurrence. Users might notice SureDrop not
working after a restart and run diagnostics to see this error in the
:guilabel:`diagnostics.txt` file.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

#. Open an ``admin power-shell`` and browse to the SureDrop installation
   directory.


#. Run the commands

   .. code:: sh

       netsh winsock reset

       netsh int ip reset

#. Run the command

   .. code:: sh

       wget "https://suredrop-downloads.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/WindowsContainerNetworking-LoggingAndCleanupAide.ps1" -outfile "WindowsContainerNetworking-LoggingAndCleanupAide.ps1"; ./WindowsContainerNetworking-LoggingAndCleanupAide.ps1 -Cleanup -ForceDeleteAllSwitches

#. Open :guilabel:`Control Panel` > :guilabel:`Device Manager` > :guilabel:`Network adapters`
    and **Uninstall all** network adapters.

#. Restart the VM.

#. Reset the static IP address on the network adapter.

#. In a powershell run the following commands-

   .. code:: sh

      stop-service docker

      Get-ContainerNetwork | Remove-ContainerNetwork
         (Select (Y))

      Get-NetNat | Remove-NetNat

#. Restart the VM.


   where the ``[HOST-IP]`` is the static IP address of your VM.

#. Run the command

   .. code:: sh

      ./suredrop start

   to reinitialise the docker stack using the previously saved answers
   and reusing the data persisted using docker volumes.

Storage mesh appears to be unavailable
--------------------------------------

For our on-premises solution, if while uploading files you see the
following storage mesh related error -

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/mesh.png
   :alt: Storage Mesh Error

Probable reasons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Please check that both the primary and secondary storage servers are
   correctly configured and accessible. If in doubt, refer to the
   ``answers.bat`` file present in the SureDrop installation directory.

   For example, the ``answers.bat`` file may have lines like

   .. code:: sh

      set storage_primary_base=\\your-server\storage01
      set storage_primary_username=suredrop
      set storage_primary_password=$Password2
      set storage_primary_type=storage-server

   in which case please verify that ``\\your-server\storage01`` is
   accessible using ``suredrop`` and ``$Password2``.

   .. Note::
      An easy way to verify is to use the ``net use`` command with
      the user credentials.

-  If you create these SMB shares on a different machine (within a
   domain) then please ensure that the user account has full access to
   them. To give the appropriate access rights and to add them to the
   ACL list please right click on the folder and choose Properties. Then
   on Sharing tab click Advanced Sharing -> Permissions and add the user
   account with Full Control permissions and click OK. Then on the
   Security tab click Advance button and add the user with Full Control
   permissions on the folder , sub folders and files and click OK and
   finally click Apply and Close on the Properties window. Remember to
   give these permissions for both the primary and backup storage
   folders.

Office 365 not working
----------------------

Refer to these :ref:`o365-known-issues`

STA integration not working
---------------------------

Refer to these :ref:`sta-known-issues`

External Database
-----------------

These :ref:`remote-db` are relatively straight forward but they miss an
important caveat, which is to do with SQL server installation.

.. Warning::

   SureDrop supports **Default instances of SQL Server** only, named instances
   will be supported soon. During installing SQL Server ensure that you 
   choose :guilabel:`Default instance` in the ``Instance Configuration``
   step.
