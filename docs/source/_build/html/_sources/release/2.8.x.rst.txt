Feature requests / enhancements implemented
-------------------------------------------

Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/dashboard.png
   :alt: Dashboard

SureDrop now has a user Dashboard to view personal or system wide
statistics (depending on the user role) in a glance. As shown in the
picture above, the dashboard shows login history, storage graph, license
details, group memberships etc. It also has the ability to search for
document notifications, file shares and audit logs. Some of the key
features are -

Shares
^^^^^^

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/shares.png
   :alt: Shared Documents

Users can now **view and cancel** shared file(s) links. They can not
only search shares based on date and time, but also filter the rows
displayed based on text from any column. To cancel shares they need to
click on the red cross at the end of each row in the table. Mouse hover
on the folder column shows the file(s) shared in the tooltip text.
Clicking on the file will take the users to the file location.

Storage
^^^^^^^

As shown in the dashboard snapshot above, storage information can be
seen either weekly, monthly or yearly in the graph. A consolidated
storage usage information card is also present in the dashboard, along
with group memberships, documents uploaded and number of groups owned.

Document activity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/doc-activity.png
   :alt: Document activity

All document notifications can be viewed in the dashboard as shown
above. Users can search and filter notifications in the same dialog.
Clicking on a document name takes you to the location, selects and
highlights the file and sorts the file table based on the selection.

Audit information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/audit.png
   :alt: Audit Information

Personal or system-wide (depending on logged-in user's role) audit logs
can be viewed from the dialog shown above. Similar to all other dialogs
in the dashboard, users can search and filter audit logs too.

Office 365 Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Downloading as Zip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/zip-menu.png
   :alt: Download As Zip

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/zip-ctx-menu.png
   :alt: Download As Zip Context Menu

As shown above, SureDrop files and folders now have the ability to be
downloaded as a Zip file. Since the archive can take a long time to be
created (depending on the file size, etc.) the users are notified
asynchronously via email when the zip is ready to be downloaded. Users
can choose to password protect or use strong encryption for the zip
files too.

File Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/select-all.png
   :alt: Select All Checkbox

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/file-actions-dropdown.png
   :alt: File Actions Dropdown Menu

We've revamped the GUI a little to make it more intuitive and
user-friendly.

There's a separate select all and deselect all menu as shown above and
the file action commands have been moved to a dropdown menu beside it.
This GUI is changing quite rapidly according to UX design guidelines and
principles. The next major version release will change the file
selection mechanism and other parts of this view.

File Search
~~~~~~~~~~~

SureDrop now has file search-ability!

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/search.png
   :alt: File Search

Based on the keyword entered in the search box, the system lists **all**
files the user has access to. The tooltips show the complete file path.
This is especially useful because now SureDrop supports multiple groups
with the same name. But simplification is never enough, we've also added
the ability to select the file when the user clicks on a row in the
search result. The file is not only selected and highlighted, but also
sorted based on selection as shown below.

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/selected.png
   :alt: Selected

Digital Rights Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/drm.png
   :alt: Digital Rights Management

We have implemented license activation as the first step towards its DRM
capabilities. Users now need to install a valid license key for using
SureDrop. The dashboard not only displays license information but also
allows the administrators to edit license information for renewing
licenses.

Version 2.8.3 - 19th Dec 2019
-----------------------------

Feature implemented
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Binary file conversion in Office 365**: SureDrop with Office 365
   does not support editing files in binary formats such as ``doc``,
   ``ppt``, and ``xls``, directly. However, Office 365 can convert
   documents in those formats to modern formats like ``docx``, ``pptx``,
   and ``xlsx``, so that users can then edit them in Office for the web.

   Conversion is almost always a lossless process, and there are
   typically very few, if any, user-visible changes to the layout and
   formatting of the document during conversion. However, this is not
   ***always*** the case, and hosts should be aware that users may wish
   to revert back to the previous binary version of the document after
   it has been converted.

   .. Note::

      This functionality is implemented as seamlessly as editing files in
      Office 365. The SureDrop user with appropriate rights should click on
      the Office 365 button beside the filename and he will be prompted with a
      confirmation dialog stating similar disclaimer as above. Upon clicking
      the submit button in the dialog (one with the green tick) a new tab will
      be opened which will convert and allow the user to edit the file. If
      such a file is converted more than once then each newly converted files
      will be named according to Windows standard of naming duplicate files
      (with a ``(NUMBER)`` at the end of the filename).

-  **Create File button** - now considers the permissions of the
   currently logged-in user. Previously the button was shown and when
   the user didn't have proper rights, then file creation would fail
   silently. Now the button has been hidden for the users who are not
   allowed to edit files in a secure group.

-  **SureDrop Read-Only groups** - now allow Word, Excel and Powerpoint
   files to be *viewed* in Office 365. If the user has appropriate
   rights for altering the file (such as group owners, administrators
   etc.) then they can also edit the file within Office 365 by choosing
   the ``Edit in browser`` button.

-  **Office 365 and PDF files** - PDF viewing in Office for the web is
   not included as part of SureDrop. There was an Office 365 button
   beside the filename in SureDrop which was a no-op, this button has
   been removed. This functionality has been deprecated by Microsoft for
   their own products too such as OneDrive. OneDrive no longer uses
   Office for the web for PDF viewing. Much has changed since Office for
   the web originally added PDF viewing support. In particular, most
   modern browsers have excellent built-in PDF support within the
   browser, and most mobile devices have excellent native PDF support as
   well. These industry advances have made the reasons support was
   originally added obsolete. Albeit SureDrop doesn't have sandbox PDF
   file viewing ability, it is only a matter of time ...
