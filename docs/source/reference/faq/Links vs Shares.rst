The difference between Links and Shares
=======================================

Share
-----

A share is a more detailed and flexible way to share a file or folder with anyone. 
Shares have a lot of options such as expiry dates and passwords and the recipients of shares don't need a SureDrop login to access them.

Shares always give the recipient access to the latest version of a file.

Recipients of shares must be entered into SureDrop at the time the share is created and each recipient gets a unique link to access the share so it can be tracked.

Links
-----

A link is a simple and fast way to share a file or folder with anyone.
Links do not have any options and recipients of links must create a SureDrop login to access them.

Also links have the special property (for files not folders)  that you are sharing a link to a particular version of a file, so the recipient won't see any later changes unless you share a new link to that file or share the folder that contains the file.

(Links to Folders always have the latest versions of the files they contain)

All recipients of links get the same link, however all recipients must log into SureDrop (or create a SureDrop account on the fly) to access a link.


Here is a table summarizing the differences
