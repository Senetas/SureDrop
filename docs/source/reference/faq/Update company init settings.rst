Update company init settings
============================

As of ``2.7.8-final`` it is possible to update the REST and Portal
locations from the web interface.

This is required when changing the IP address of the SureDrop server or
changing the DNS name.

To update these details log into SureDrop as an administrator and browse
to the Admin page and select the Company Init Settings option.

This will display the following dialog.

The Portal and REST API locations are shown.

When entering the REST API specifically, you are required to validate
the API location prior to the OK button being enabled by clicking on the
Test Button.

.. Important::
   Please log out then log back in again at the new portal location for the
   changes to take effect.
