Version 2.10.x
==============

Version Information
-------------------

This is a minor version upgrade which was published as a dot-zero only
because it involves a database schema change. All version information
and release deliverables are same as the previous :ref:`version2-9-x`.

Feature requests / enhancements implemented
-------------------------------------------

File upload speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have improved the file upload speed by a factor of two! This was done
by re-engineering the way uploads were processed in the backend.

Upload chunk size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have also re-optimised the file upload chunk size based on our
performance tests.

+-----------------------------------------------------+--------------+
| File size                                           | Chunk size   |
+=====================================================+==============+
| Greater than 10 MB but less than or equal to 1 GB   | 10 MB        |
+-----------------------------------------------------+--------------+
| Greater than 1 GB but less than or equal to 10 GB   | 100 MB       |
+-----------------------------------------------------+--------------+
| Greater than 10 GB                                  | 500 MB       |
+-----------------------------------------------------+--------------+

Minor Releases
--------------

Version 2.10.1 - 27th Feb 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Explicit file version**: We've made the file version information a
   first class citizen of the folder and file data table. This was a
   better UX design.

Version 2.10.2 - 4th Mar 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Separate Azure AD and LDAP configuration**: We separated the Azure
   AD Integration and LDAP integration in the Admin page and made them
   mutually exclusive. We also added a third identity provider
   configuration page for SafeNet Trusted Access.

   <hr>

Version 2.10.3 - 4th Mar 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Standardised UI for Identity Providers**: In the admin page we
   brought the identity provider settings together in the GUI making it
   more intuitive and meaningful for the user.

Version 2.10.4 - 5th Mar 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Maintenance release (For non-production use only)*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   <hr>

Version 2.10.5 - 5th Mar 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **File refresh issue**: This was a minor timing issue in refreshing
   the GUI. Uploaded files were not appearing in the documents grid
   without a manual refresh. This issue was introduced by the changes
   done for making the file uploads faster.

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

Version 2.10.6 - 12th Mar 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Identity Provider Settings**: The IDP settings in the Admin page
   has been redesigned and brought under a common parent. Thales' STA
   has been added to the GUI, and the backend supports a hand-shake
   only. The next release will fully integrate STA with SureDrop.

-  **Feature toggles**: Feature Toggles (often also referred to as
   Feature Flags) are a powerful technique, allowing teams to modify
   system behaviour without changing code. It facilitates continuous
   delivery and other important Agile software development practices.
   Read `this
   page <https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html>`__ if
   you're feeling pedantic.

-  **Multi-lingual SureDrop**: This enhancement laid the foundation of
   extending SureDrop's UI to support localisation (multiple languages).
   The feature is presently hidden behind a toggle for production
   instances.

Version 2.10.7 - 24th Mar 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enhancements implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **STA Integration**: SureDrop now supports Thales' SafeNet Trusted
   Advisor as an identity provider. Please refer to our :ref:`sta` document
   to configure and enable this.

-  **Manually import users in bulk**: Users can now be manually imported
   to SureDrop via a delimited comma-separated text (CSV) file. Manually
   importing user records enables you to add numerous users in a single
   operation. Please refer to our :doc:`documentation<../deep/Manually Import Users>`
   to understand the necessity for implementing this feature.

-  **Importing users from Azure AD**: We discovered that SureDrop could
   only import 100 users from Azure AD. This issue was due to the way
   SureDrop was interacting with Azure AD. It didn't support pagination.

-  **Folder sharing**: This was yet another example of how imperative
   user feedback is for our progress. One of our users reported that
   ``clicking share from ellipsis menu ( "..." in Actions column) failed when doing it on a folder``
   and we resolved it as quickly as we possibly could.

Version 2.10.8 - 24th Mar 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Login using Azure AD**: We discovered a pesky issue during logging
   in using Azure AD in our internal testing and resolved it.

Version 2.10.11 - 10th April 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Reset Password**: We now have the much sought after
   ``Forgot Password`` functionality in SureDrop. The way it works is
   based on your username SureDrop now sends a secure password reset
   token via email to local SureDrop users. This token can be used only
   once, expires in 24 hours if unused, and also expires in 30 minutes
   if you click on it and don't reset the password. SureDrop
   administrators with :doc:`single-sign-on <../integrations/IDP>` 
   accounts have to now setup their SupportDetails for this reset
   password functionality.

-  **Bookmark prompt**: SureDrop has added a
   ``Please remember to bookmark this page`` prompt to the login page.
   Users can choose not to display this message and this choice is
   remembered in the backend. Once hidden there is no way to get this
   prompt back again, so please ensure you've bookmarked your SureDrop
   URL.

-  **Use OIDC for Azure AD**: This is a technical feature and has no
   impact (or even noticeable enhancement) for end users. For many
   months now Microsoft has been **``strongly recommending``** to
   migrate applications from Azure AD Graph API to Microsoft Graph API.
   If you're feeling pedantic, please checkout
   `this <https://developer.microsoft.com/office/blogs/microsoft-graph-or-azure-ad-graph/>`__
   blog for a more detailed explanation on why this migration is
   essential. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol built
   on OAuth 2.0 that you can use to securely sign in a user to a web
   application. The protocol specs are given
   `here <https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html>`__ and
   the sequence diagram for the sign-in is shown below:

      :alt: License details

-  **Large file uploads**: We have now implemented an intelligent
   ratcheting throttling system for large file uploads. Files now appear
   as ``processing`` as soon as they're uploaded until all the backend
   jobs like compressing and encrypting are completed. This solves many
   errors we found with uploading large files.

-  **Download notification**: When a user clicked on a link from a
   download notification email, it took them to the wrong folder. This
   was solved by URL encoding the file location.

-  **Sharing passwords**: Complex sharing passwords with special
   characters were not being accepted in the sharing page once the users
   uploaded files to it, or the page timed out. This happened due to
   incorrectly sanitising JSON snippet (including the password) in the
   backend.

-  **Searching files in deactivated groups**: Standard and restricted
   users were able to search and get to files within deactivated groups.
   We've closed this security issue by displaying documents from
   deactivated groups only when the Show Deactivated Groups option is
   checked. Standard and restricted users don't have the necessary
   permissions to show deactivated groups and therefore cannot get to
   the files in them.

-  **CSS caching**: We got rid of some pesky aggressive browser caching
   issues across version upgrades.

-  **File sharing**: There was a synchronisation hole in file sharing
   across browser sessions. Once sharing is disabled by the admin, users
   with valid session tokens could still share files using their
   browser. After this bugfix the users with valid session tokens will
   get an error notification informing them about the change in the
   system state.

-  **Undelete documents**: are no longer allowed on deactivated groups.

-  **Renaming files**: didn't work as expected and defaulted to
   previously renamed file. Sometimes a rename was stuck in the
   processing state and couldn't be recovered until the file was
   re-uploaded.

-  **Update username**: External users had to be deleted and
   resynchronised to SureDrop if an administrator changed their username
   in the IDP system. This was because username is a unique entity in
   SureDrop and cannot be modified. The background IDP sync agent has
   been modified to accommodate this external change and usernames are
   now synchronised every couple of minutes.

-  **Azure AD users**: SureDrop could only import 100 users from Azure
   AD. This is the default page size for Azure AD Graph API responses
   from Microsoft. As part of implementing OIDC for Azure AD we fixed
   this defect by correctly implementing paging using Microsoft Graph
   APIs.

-  **Notify All**: also notified the currently logged in user if he/she
   was a member of the currently selected security group. This unwanted
   email has now been skipped and all members of the group except the
   current user are notified.

Version 2.10.12 - 14th April 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Large File Upload enhancement**: Large files now show a progress bar showing
   the status of the background processing applied to each upload.

-  **Large File Upload defect**: Resolved an issue where each upload chunk
   displayed as a new version of the file.

   <hr>

Version 2.10.13 - 16th April 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Synchronise STA Users**: SureDrop sync agent was considering some
   mandatory user attributes for STA and didn't have aggressive logging.
   We have changed this to make the user download more fault tolerant
   (defensive) and verbose (logging)

-  **Cancel file upload**: Users can now cancel individual (or all) file
   uploads. SureDrop deletes all cancelled files in the background.

-  **Browser performance**: We noticed that multiple large file uploads
   were consuming too much memory in the browser and making it slower.
   We have reduced this memory consumption impact significantly.

Version 2.10.14 - 17th April 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Office 365**: Due to the upload performance changes done in
   previous point releases, some of the Office 365 functionalities such
   as creating new files were not working.

-  **Manual username**: Administrators were unable to enter manual
   usernames during adding new users. This has been fixed in the GUI.

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

Version 2.10.15 - 18th April 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **STA Auto login**: Added support for STA users to login
   automatically to SureDrop by appending
   ``username=<sta-user-name>&login=auto`` to the service login URL of
   the STA OIDC application. So, the complete URL should now look
   something similar to this -

   .. code:: sh

      https://<your-suredrop-home-url>/#viewLogin?company=<your-suredrop-company-name>&username=<you-sta-username>&login=auto

Version 2.10.16 - 30th April 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Internationalisation**: SureDrop is now available in thirteen new
   languages using UTF-8 for international characters. The languages
   supported are *Arabic, Chinese (simplified and traditional), French,
   German, Indonesian, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Polish, Spanish
   and Thai*.
   This localisation feature has been enabled for our SaaS environments
   and needs a minor DB configuration for on-prem customers. Please
   reach out to your SureDrop administrator if you have SureDrop
   installed on your own premises and would like to enable this
   functionality.

-  **Version during multi-select**: When multiple files are selected
   SureDrop disables the ``V`` button to restrict users from trying to
   get to the version information.

-  **Compressing files and folders**: Due to the asynchronous nature of
   file uploads SureDrop was sending out emails about zip files too
   soon, when the file wasn't ready yet.

-  **Progress bars**: For large file uploads the progress bars in the
   file table and the upload queue were not in sync.

-  **Session token**: SureDrop session token wasn't counting down /
   timing out during bulk file uploads.

-  **Remember me**: There were some minor problems with the way SureDrop
   handles cookies when the ``Remember Me`` option was not selected.

Version 2.10.17 - 16th June 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Expand STA**: Thales had requested for expanding :guilabel:`STA` to
   :guilabel:`Safenet Trusted Access`. This has now been updated in GUI.

-  **Rename context menu**: We were told that the right-click context menu
   ``Download as zip`` was a misnomer and should be renamed to its actual
   functionality ``Zip selected files``. This has now been updated in GUI.
