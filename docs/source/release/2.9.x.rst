Feature requests / enhancements implemented
-------------------------------------------

.. _version:

Versioning
~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../images/2.10.0/version.gif
   :alt: Version

Document versioning refers to the use and management of multiple
versions of a document. This is more generally known as file versioning
or file version management, for general file types. The idea behind
document versioning is that SureDrop should be able to handle multiple
versions of a single file and provide access to users. It is now
possible to recover previous versions of a file and see the version
history. This feature is accessible by clicking on the “Info” button on
a document.

Collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now possible to add comments to document versions and to add a
description to a document. This allows multiple users to collaborate and
understand the purpose of document updates. To access this feature use
the same "Info" button on a document shown in document :ref:`version`. 
For real time collaborations however, consider using your Office 365 account 
in SureDrop.

Maintenance Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/maintenance-mode.png
   :alt: Maintenance Mode

There is now a maintenance mode which allows the system to alert users
when maintenance is about to take place. Non admin users are warned and
then logged out.

Secure Ad-hoc Sharing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/sharing.png
   :alt: Adhoc Sharing

It is now possible to add a password to an ad-hoc share. Document
notifications are now available on both download and upload. The sharing
page now times out due to inactivity.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: ../images/2.10.0/notify-selected.png
   :alt: Notify Selected

Document notifications are now clearer and now highlight the relevant
files. The username is also pre-populated for your convenience when you
click on the link in the notification email.

UX updates
~~~~~~~~~~

The user interface has been updated (standardised) to make it more
intuitive for selecting and downloading files.

   :alt: UX Updates

Defects resolved
----------------

-  **User Preferences** - User preferences are now stored in the
   backend, which means the the tour dialog will no longer keep popping
   up every time the browser cache is cleared.

-  **IE11** - While we do not support IE11, a large effort was made to
   attempt to make as many of SureDrops features work as possible.

-  **Background operations** - Background operations were introduced for
   some long running processes. Renaming, deleting and copying a folder
   are all now background operations.

-  **Modals** - Feedback and sharing were both moved to modal dialogs to
   improve consistency.

Upgrades
--------

SureDrop upgrade process is seamless and easy via the
``create-suredrop.bat`` script as described in :ref:`upgrade`.

Minor Releases
--------------

Version 2.9.1 - 14th Feb 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Cannot see pending users**: Some legacy systems have users without
   any default roles associated with them. SureDrop 2.9.0 failed to load
   those users and any subsequent users due to a JS exception in code.

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

Version 2.9.2 - 18th Feb 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Multiple files drag and drop**: As part of making the cut and paste
   operation asynchronous (in the background) we inadvertently
   introduced a timing issue where sometimes dragging and dropping
   multiple files moved only some of the selected files. The selected
   files were deleted from the source location but didn't end up in the
   destination, which made non-administrators lose the file completely.

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

Version 2.9.3 - 19th Feb 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Special characters in password**: SureDrop sanitises every bit of
   data that flows in to the APIs. As part of security changes we got a
   little carried away and sanitised the passwords too; which meant that
   users couldn't use some special characters in their passwords.
