Features / enhancements implemented
-----------------------------------

Shareable links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A link is a simple, fast and easy way to share a file or folder with anyone. They do not have any options and recipients of links 
must create a SureDrop login to access them (for security purposes). These are :ref:`links-vs-shares` in SureDrop.

Getting a link

Outlook integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have now created an add-in that integrates SureDrop with Microsoft Outlook. By connecting the SureDrop add-in to 
your Outlook account, you can:

- Replace email attachments with a shared link to any file, big or small
- Save email attachments that you receive directly to your SureDrop account 

The details of connecting Outlook with SureDrop can be found in the :ref:`outlook` page.

SureDrop in Russian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our i18n is now extended to support Russian locale. That means we now officially support the following lanugages -

Download as zip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SureDrop files and folders can now be downloaded as a zip archive on-the-fly. That means the archive is created on-demand 
totally asynchronously and does not buffer any intermediate files in memory. It is a completely transparent operation to
the end user and provides the ability to share folders including sub-folders, a much awaited feature in SureDrop.

Notifications with message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can now include a note / message along with the ``Notify Selected`` and ``Notify All`` operations. This was a feature
request to standardise adhoc sharing and notification workflows.

Group membership badge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a user yet to activate his SureDrop account is added to a group, his membership is shown in the GUI as an inactive
badge. The user details can be viewed as a tooltip on hover.

Changes to MFA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SureDrop multi-factor authentication has now been restricted local users only. All external (federated) users will 
  manage their MFA with the respective identity provider (Azure, LDAP or STA). 

- SureDrop administrators can now view, filter and sort users based on their MFA.

- Turning on MFA company wide now prompts the administrators about resetting local user accounts which don't have 
  MFA turned on.

Folder size
~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can now view folder sizes on demand by clicking the ``Get Size`` button. The functionality has been extended
to folders shown in documents, links and adhoc sharing pages.

Restricted users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- With the advent of zipping files on-the-fly, we have removed the ``My Documents`` group for restricted users. The 
  only reason for that group to exist for restricted users, was to act as a destination for zipped files. This is no
  longer required. 

- The link and shares page looks a bit different for restricted users. They are not authorised to view sent links and
  shares.

Minor Releases
--------------

Version 2.11.1 - 21st September 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Downloading folder (cloud)** - There was a configuration error in the Canberra region of our 
  `SaaS <https://portal.sdrop.com/#/viewLogin>`_ instance. This leads to failure in downloading 
  folders. 

- **Outlook addin documentation** - The link in the Connect Outlook dialog in SureDrop, now points at
  :ref:`install-addin`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Sharing View** - In some cases files were not shown in the ``Share View`` unless the user selected the ``File View`` then went back to the ``Share View``.

  Filenames now use the full column width and show in the tooltip.
