Features / enhancements implemented
-----------------------------------

Shareable links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A link is a simple, fast and easy way to share a file or folder with anyone. They do not have any options and recipients of links 
must create a SureDrop login to access them (for security purposes). These are :ref:`links-vs-shares` in SureDrop.

Getting a link

Outlook integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have now created an add-in that integrates SureDrop with Microsoft Outlook. By connecting the SureDrop add-in to 
your Outlook account, you can:

- Replace email attachments with a shared link to any file, big or small
- Save email attachments that you receive directly to your SureDrop account 

The details of connecting Outlook with SureDrop can be found in the :ref:`outlook` page.

SureDrop in Russian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our i18n is now extended to support Russian locale. That means we now officially support the following lanugages -

.. image:: ../images/2.11/i18n.png

Download as zip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SureDrop files and folders can now be downloaded as a zip archive on-the-fly. That means the archive is created on-demand 
totally asynchronously and does not buffer any intermediate files in memory. It is a completely transparent operation to
the end user and provides the ability to share folders including sub-folders, a much awaited feature in SureDrop.

.. image:: ../images/2.11/SharingFolders.png

Notifications with message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can now include a note / message along with the ``Notify Selected`` and ``Notify All`` operations. This was a feature
request to standardise adhoc sharing and notification workflows. 

.. image:: ../images/2.11/Notification.gif

Group membership badge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a user yet to activate his SureDrop account is added to a group, his membership is shown in the GUI as an inactive
badge. The user details can be viewed as a tooltip on hover.

.. image:: ../images/2.11/PendingBadges.png

Changes to MFA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- SureDrop multi-factor authentication has now been restricted local users only. All external (federated) users will 
  manage their MFA with the respective identity provider (Azure, LDAP or STA). 

- SureDrop administrators can now view, filter and sort users based on their MFA.

- Turning on MFA company wide now prompts the administrators about resetting local user accounts which don't have 
  MFA turned on.

Folder size
~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can now view folder sizes on demand by clicking the ``Get Size`` button. The functionality has been extended
to folders shown in documents, links and adhoc sharing pages.

  .. image:: /images/2.11/FolderSize.png

Restricted users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- With the advent of zipping files on-the-fly, we have removed the ``My Documents`` group for restricted users. The 
  only reason for that group to exist for restricted users, was to act as a destination for zipped files. This is no
  longer required. 

- The link and shares page looks a bit different for restricted users. They are not authorised to view sent links and
  shares.

Minor Releases
--------------

Version 2.11.1 - 21st September 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Downloading folder (cloud)** - There was a configuration error in the Canberra region of our 
  `SaaS <https://portal.sdrop.com/#/viewLogin>`_ instance. This leads to failure in downloading 
  folders. 

- **Outlook addin documentation** - The link in the Connect Outlook dialog in SureDrop, now points at
  :ref:`install-addin`.

Version 2.11.2 - 22nd September 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Get Link using Safari** - we have had to change some code to support ``Get Link`` operation in Safari. 

- **Icon sizes** - we have slightly modified the icons in file and folder view to standardise it with other pages.

- **Changing language on adhoc sharing page** - was redirecting the user to the login page. 

- **Sharing password** - using the browser's auto-fill functionality for email addresses, was also populating
  the password field as well.

Version 2.11.3 - 29th September 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Sharing View** - In some cases files were not shown in the ``Share View`` unless the user selected the ``File View`` then went back to the ``Share View``.

Version 2.11.5 - 2nd October 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Updated Language Translations** - Updated some missing language translations.

- **Settings Bug** - Resolved issue where all of the settings were not being returned in all cases via
  the ``settings`` API.

Version 2.11.6 - 10th December 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  *A maintenance release (For non-production use only)*

Version 2.11.7 - 21st December 2020
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **View-only groups** - We have added a new policy in the edit group dialog which allows the group owner
  (or an administrator) to set a security group as view-only. In a view-only security group files can only 
  be uploaded by the group owner. Group members can only view files and **not download** them. Thus by definition,
  view only groups are read-only with sharing disabled.

  .. image:: ../images/2.11/ViewOnly.png

- **Sandbox viewer** - SureDrop users now have the ability to view more than 140 file types natively within the browser.
  This much awaited capability coupled with view-only groups, tightens the security model for organisations with sensitive
  documents. To prevent users from taking screenshots or photos of their screen, the documents are rendered in the browser
  page-by-page as images with a watermark containing company name, time-stamp and user name of the viewer. Users can click
  on the rendered image to get to advance viewing options such as rotating, zooming, or flipping the image.

- **Client fingerprinting** - SureDrop client sessions have been fingerprinted for authentication and authorisation at the server.
  This means that the session token for each session is locked to a single client IP address and client agent string and it is not 
  possible to copy the URL of an authenticated session and paste it in another browser. Users will need to reauthenticate themselves 
  if the fingerprinting fails at the server side. Albeit some may consider this a hindrance to usability, we believe it is a necessary 
  enhancement to our security model.

- **Retry failed uploads** - Uploads that have failed will now retry every minute automatically. This means that for those large 
  uploads where a single slice fails, you will no longer need to manually click on the retry button for that slice.

- **Opera** - is now supported, taking our list of supported browsers to:

  - Safari

  - Firefox

  - Chrome

  - Edge

  - Opera
