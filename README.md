# Who needs SureDrop
SureDrop clients are a mix of financial institutions, government agencies, professional services organisations, telecommunications service providers and major commercial businesses. They all have one thing in common: they are concerned about the inherent risks associated with sharing documents outside of their protected LAN. 

Communications technology service providers can simply add SureDrop as an additional security component to their Internet services portfolio, delivering ground-breaking document encryption protection as-a-service. 

Employees are often the weak link in the data security chain; engaging in risky behavior that breaches security and compliance policies – such as the use of private file sharing accounts with public service providers. 

Employers need the 100% control and defense-grade encryption of SureDrop to eliminate public file sharing and provide maximum data protection.
